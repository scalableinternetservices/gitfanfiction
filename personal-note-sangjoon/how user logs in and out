log in

client user sends email and password

server receives it

if it matches, saves authtoken and userid in session

sends cookie with authtoken : authtoken.string

when client talks to server, always has cookie

when graphql receives post, it first goes through middleware

if authtoken exists, search for user with authtoken




log off

server receives request with authtoken from cookie

removes authtoken from session

sends updated cookie with authtoken : ""
